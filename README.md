# Spring React User Profile Demo

A demo to showcase a user profile with a dashboard that has permissions to access certain areas of the dashboard implemented with OAuth2, Spring Boot, Spring Security 6 + JWT, and ReactJS.

# Project Structure

The project is divided into 3 parts: the front-end, the back-end, and tests. The front-end is built using ReactJS, and the back-end is built using Spring Boot. The front-end is served from the back-end server. The front-end is located at [src/frontend](src/frontend), and the back-end is located at [src/main](src/main).

here's what the project structure looks like when you open the src folder:
